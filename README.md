# shader-patcherx
### Simple bash script to increase the shader cache size globally on your Linux system.

Effective on decreasing loading times and stutters, specially in recently released games. 

Compatible only with systems running **bash** or **zsh** as their default shell.

## Systems known to be compatible

## Systems known to be incompatible

`chmod +x patcher.sh`\
`./patcher.sh`
